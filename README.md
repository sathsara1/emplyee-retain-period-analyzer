# Employee attrition

Employee attrition, also known as employee turnover, is a pressing challenge faced by organisations across industries. High attrition rates not only lead to increased recruitment and training costs but also result in the loss of valuable expertise, reduced productivity, and negative impacts on team morale. 

In this project, we use machine learning techniques to predict, based on organisational, professional, and demographic characteristics, whether an employee will leave the company within a year after joining. 

We compare two supervised learning algorithms, **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**, using the Employee Attrition Dataset. 

**Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC** are some of the metrics we use to compare their predictive performance. 

Our results show that interpretability and predictive power are traded off, with Random Forest demonstrating superior predictive performance and Logistic Regression offering clear insights into attrition factors. The findings provide HR departments with practical suggestions for anticipating and mitigating retention risks.
